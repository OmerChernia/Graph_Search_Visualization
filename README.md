# Graph Search Visualization

Graph Search Visualization is a Next.js application that demonstrates graph search algorithms in an interactive and visual way. The app leverages modern web technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to provide a responsive and component-driven UI for exploring various graph search techniques.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** See how graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A\*, PHS, etc.) work in real time.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose between different search algorithms to see their behaviors.
- **Dynamic Graph Editing:** Add, connect, and modify graph nodes and edges interactively.
- **Heuristic Visualizations:** For algorithms like A\* and PHS, visualize the cost and heuristic values.
- **Reusable UI Components:** Built using custom components like Button, Card, Input, and Select for a consistent experience.
